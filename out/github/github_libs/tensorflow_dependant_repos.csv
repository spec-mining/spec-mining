Recently, there have beensignificant advances through the application of machine learningtechniques, especially deep neural networks. Unfortunately, to-datemany of the proposed methods are evaluated on different (data,software/hardware, hyperparameter) setups and consequently it isnearly impossible to compare the efficacy of the available methodsor reproduce results presented in original research manuscripts.In this paper, we propose a causal inference toolbox (CauseBox)that addresses the aforementioned problems. At the time of thewriting, the toolbox includes seven state of the art causal inferencemethods and two benchmark datasets. By providing convenientcommand-line and GUI-based interfaces, theCauseBoxtoolboxhelps researchers fairly compare the state of the art methods intheir chosen application context against benchmark datasets.",setup.py,tensorflow,2021-08-22T19:19:37Z

Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are a promising tool to approximate (partial) differential equations. PINNs are not suited for control tasks in their original form since they are not designed to handle variable control actions or variable initial values. We thus present the idea of enhancing PINNs by adding control actions and initial conditions as additional network inputs. The high-dimensional input space is subsequently reduced via a sampling strategy and a zero-hold assumption. This strategy enables the controller design based on a PINN as an approximation of the underlying system dynamics. The additional benefit is that the sensitivities are easily computed via automatic differentiation, thus leading to efficient gradient-based algorithms. Finally, we present our results using our PINN-based MPC to solve a tracking problem for a complex mechanical system, a multi-link manipulator.",requirements.txt,tensorflow,2021-09-22T07:05:40Z
